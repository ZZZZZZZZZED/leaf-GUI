# A LEAF User Interface with Streamlit
 
This project is based on practising the introductory examples in the [original LEAF example](https://github.com/dos-group/leaf/tree/main/examples) in the python version, users can directly watch the power usage in user-modified infrastructure and application chart. This application is conducted through [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for fast-built data representation. 

Some new methods were introduced in the leaf-GUI for agile and compatibility usage; as a result, users will no longer need to write [complex loops for writing to csv](https://github.com/dos-group/leaf/blob/b6a2c92cafa614f1f0adde4f5b581d9d0a461937/examples/smart_city_traffic/main.py#L56-L78), and [modify how each data](https://github.com/dos-group/leaf/tree/main/examples/smart_city_traffic/analysis) would be displayed in the final chart.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Get start!

Set up your environment and run:
```python
streamlit run LEAF.py
```


## üöÄ How does it work?

For LEAF starters, you can just input [examples](https://github.com/ZZZZZZZZZED/leaf-GUI/tree/main/examples) in the python interpreter on the home page. Then, click 'run simulator' and check the results.

### If you are running your unique script:
Please do not forget to add this line for you to easily draw and classify lines in the graph for each [power meter](https://leaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/power.html).

```python
import csv_handler as ch
```

To understand why we are importing csv_handler, use the original [smart_city_traffic](https://github.com/dos-group/leaf/blob/main/examples/smart_city_traffic/main.py) code snippet as an exampleÔºö

Set power meters:
```python
env.process(pm_cloud.run(env))
env.process(pm_fog.run(env))
env.process(pm_wan_up.run(env))
env.process(pm_wan_down.run(env))
env.process(pm_wifi.run(env))
```
Then

Original method write results to csv:
```python
csv_content = "time,cloud static,cloud dynamic,fog static,fog dynamic,wifi static,wifi dynamic,wanUp static," \
                      "wanUp dynamic,wanDown static,wanDown dynamic\n"
for i, (cloud, fog, wifi, wan_up, wan_down) in enumerate(zip(pm_cloud.measurements, pm_fog.measurements, pm_wifi.measurements, pm_wan_up.measurements, pm_wan_down.measurements)):
csv_content += f"{i},{cloud.static},{cloud.dynamic},{fog.static},{fog.dynamic},{wifi.static},{wifi.dynamic},{wan_up.static},{wan_up.dynamic},{wan_down.static},{wan_down.dynamic}\n"
with open(f"{result_dir}/infrastructure.csv", 'w') as csvfile:
            csvfile.write(csv_content)
```

The above code block shows the efforts made in the [original script](https://github.com/dos-group/leaf/blob/b6a2c92cafa614f1f0adde4f5b581d9d0a461937/examples/smart_city_traffic/main.py#L66-L72) to visualize some power meters; however, this code is not reusable and complex. Moreover, even with continued use of this method, some LEAF simulator characteristics such as [sampling frequency](https://github.com/dos-group/leaf/blob/b6a2c92cafa614f1f0adde4f5b581d9d0a461937/leaf/power.py#L182) and [delay](https://github.com/dos-group/leaf/blob/b6a2c92cafa614f1f0adde4f5b581d9d0a461937/leaf/power.py#L200-L207) are difficult to solve.

So, a more convinent method we suggest here would be:

```python
ch.output_csv(PM=pm_cloud, rename='Cloud',type = 1)
ch.output_csv(PM=pm_fog, rename='Fog',type = 1)
ch.output_csv(PM=pm_wan_up, rename='Wan up',type = 1)
ch.output_csv(PM=pm_wan_down, rename='Wan down',type = 1)
ch.output_csv(PM=pm_wifi, rename='WIFI',type = 1)
```
The output_csv method takes three parameters:
```
(PM = power meter instance, rename = 'name you want in the graph', type = 1 is for infrastructure type = 2 is for application)
```

Finally, don't forget to add
```python
ch.merge_results()
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks

Because of the existing defects of streamlit, if there is a cell with the value NAN in a column, the whole column will disappear on the graph. Therefore, this project fills NAH with valid upward values to compensate for the missing data caused by different sampling intervals. This may lead to a bias between the final result and the actual power usage in practical applications. However, according to the statistics principle: the larger the sample, the smaller the error. We can conclude that when the user reduces the sampling frequency, the user also tolerates and accepts data error since users decide the value of the interval. So there is not much of a real problem with our approach that needs to be discussed.

For better conducting the living chart, it is best not to simulate more than 3600 seconds, which is a simulated hour, because a large amount of data flow may cause the page to get stuck, but after waiting for a period of calculation time, the final result will be displayed correctly. Suppose you must simulate the power consumption in an extensive time background, such as 3600*24, to find out the difference between day and night. In that case, you can get the CSV file through [original LEAF](https://github.com/dos-group/leaf) and import the CSV file on the home page by the ‚Äòimport results‚Äô button, and the development will be displayed correctly.
